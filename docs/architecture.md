⚠️ **Minor Gaps Identified:**
- Circuit breaker pattern not implemented (acceptable for MVP scale)
- Advanced performance monitoring tools not included (cost constraint consideration)

#### 6. Security & Compliance ✅ (90% Pass Rate)

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- **Secure Implementation:** Werkzeug password hashing, Flask-Login session management
- **Access Control:** User-based script ownership, session-based route protection
- **Credential Management:** Environment variable configuration for sensitive data

**Data Security:**
- **File Security:** Upload validation, quarantine directory, file size limits
- **Execution Security:** Isolated subprocess execution, working directory separation
- **Data Protection:** SQLite database file permissions, log file access controls

⚠️ **Security Considerations:**
- HTTPS configuration documented but implementation details needed for production
- Input validation strategy defined but specific sanitization rules need expansion

#### 7. Implementation Guidance ✅ (95% Pass Rate)

**AI Agent Readiness:**
- **Clear Patterns:** Consistent code organization, predictable file structures
- **Component Boundaries:** Well-defined interfaces between services, repositories, and controllers
- **Implementation Examples:** Template code provided for key patterns (controller, service, repository)

**Development Environment:**
